= Automated Workshops

== Purpose

This collection of ansible playbooks and corresponding asciidoc-based workshops is designed to make it easier to build out demos and workshops.

== Structure

=== Ansible

The ansible code is a collection of roles and playbooks that are designed (in theory) to be stacked on top of one another to build out complex environments.

=== Asciidoc

The asciidoc files are collections of full workshops as well as snippets that can be copied/pasted to form larger and more dense workshops as desired.

=== TODO

Right now there is no direct relationship between the ansible code and the workshop documentation. Eventually I'd like to get to a structure where ansible renders parts of the asciidoc code at build time to make the data integrate seamlessly.
